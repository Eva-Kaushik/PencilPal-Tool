This project was initiated with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Commands at Your Disposal

To execute commands, navigate to the project directory and run:

### `yarn start`

This command launches the application in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits.<br />
You'll also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

This command initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode.<br />
For more information on running tests, visit the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `yarn build`

This command compiles the application for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It optimizes the build for the best performance and includes React in production mode.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br />
Your application is now ready for deployment!

For more information on deployment, check out the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `yarn eject`

**Please note: This action is irreversible. Once you `eject`, there's no going back!**

If you're dissatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you have the option to `eject` at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, granting you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will continue to function, but they'll refer to the copied scripts, allowing you to customize them. From this point forward, you're on your own.

You aren't obligated to use `eject`. The provided feature set is suitable for small to medium deployments, and you're under no pressure to utilize this feature. However, we acknowledge that this tool wouldn't be valuable if customization wasn't an option when you're prepared for it.
